        <p>This plot depicts the humidty at cities polled in different latitudes. 
            It would appear that there isn't a very strong correlation here because there are cities in all latitudes with a humidity of 100%.
            However, the data for the northern hemisphere seems highly random. With a large cluster at 50-70 degrees that sits between 70-90% humidity.
            This is counter balanced by the couple of extremes at 60-70 degrees that are at 0% humidity.
