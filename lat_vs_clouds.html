            This plot represents the cloud cover of various cities polled at different latitudes.
            This data seems highly estimated as most of the data points sit at 0%, 20%, 40%, 75% and 90%.
            However, between 0 degrees and 40 degrees it's either NO clouds or A LOT of clouds. This would make sense as most tropical storms hit populated areas in this zone, but there are also populated areas in deserts in the middle east.
