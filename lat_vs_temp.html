        <p>This plot would seem to indicate a correlation between latitude and temperature.
            The average temperatures for each latitude in the northern hemisphere seem to be lower, but as you get further from the equator they vary wildly.
            Still, though; the temperatures for the southern hemisphere are generally higher at the same distances from the equator.
