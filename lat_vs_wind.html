            Here we are looking at City Latitude versus Windspeed for the date polled.
            We can see that between 0 and -20 degrees the wind speed doesn't top 15mph, and skews heavily to very slow speeds. Further south than that it seems that the average is around 10 mph.
            In the northern hemisphere, however, the windspeed varies greatly the further north you go. It seems that there is a decent correlation here, but one must start at 0 degrees and go either direction.
